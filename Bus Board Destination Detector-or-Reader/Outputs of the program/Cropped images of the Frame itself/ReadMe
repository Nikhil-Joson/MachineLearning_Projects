This folder contains the cropped parts of the frame itself, in which there are different objects.
From this folder we select the cropped images (ones containing the Buses) as completely new images, to further detect the writing in them.
Have used Yolo-v3 for detection of any objects in the images.
As you can see each cropped image in this folder is named ny the object present in them, this is automatically done by the code, and that helps us to
easily use only the ones with their names ahving 'Bus' in them.
